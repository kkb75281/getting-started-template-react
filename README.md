# Skapi React Starter Template

This is a React starter template for Skapi.

This template includes basic features for your React application:

- Signup
- Signup email verification
- Login

## How To Run

1. Download the project and unzip it.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will be hosted on port `3000` by default.

## Remote Server (Optional)

If you want to host this on a remote server, you can build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then serve the contents of the `build` folder using your preferred static server.

## Important!

Replace the `SERVICE_ID` and `OWNER_ID` values in `src/skapi.js` with your own service information.

Currently, the service is running in **Trial Mode**.

**All user data will be deleted every 14 days.**

You can get your own service ID from [Skapi](https://www.skapi.com).
